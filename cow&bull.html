		<p>Bulls and Cows in an ancient code breaking mind game in which the player is required to 
		identify a four digit secret number by making guess. Each guess made by the player in evaluated
		and the number bulls and cows are displayed. By analysing these informations the player would be able to
		predict the correct code after a few attempts. Each digit of the secret code is a number between 0 and 9(inclusive)
		and all digits are discrete.</p>

		<summary><h3 style="display: inline;">What are Bulls?</h3></summary>
		<p>A Bull represents that a digit you have entered in present in the exact same position in the secret code.
		So the number of bulls say the number of digits that are present in the secret code and also at the exact 
		same position. For example,</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">5146 - Actual Code
			<br>
		2186 - Guessed Code</p>
		<p>The number of bulls in the above guess is two as digits 1 and 6 are there in the secret code and are also in the same position</p>

		<summary><h3 style="display: inline;">What are Cows?</h3></summary>
		<p>A Cows represents that a digit you have entered is present in the secret code but not in the estimated position.
		So the number of cows say the number of digits that are present in the secret code but not in the position that you have 
		guessed. For example,</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">5146 - Actual Code
			<br>
		1594 - Guessed Code</p>
		<p>The number of cows in the above guess is two as digits 5 and 4 are there in the secret code but not in the expected position.</p>
		<p>Note: In the above example there is a bull too. Also a digit can never be bull and a cow at the same time</p>
